# Recipe Finder

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This recipe finder application helps users find recipes based off of keywords they enter.

Upon loading the application's landing page, the user will be greeted with an input bar containing placeholder text which reads "enter ingredients". The user will then enter a keyword, such as "vegan", "beans", or "strawberry" and then click on the "Get recipe" button below the input field. 

Upon clicking the "Get recipe" button, the application will generate 5 recipes featuring the keyword, all of which come from the Spoonacular API we used to power this application. 

Below the input and button field, there is also a "Previous Searches" section which will be initally blank, but will fill up with the keywords used in each previous search. For example, if the user has already, searched for recipes containing the keywords "banana" and "kiwi", these will appear as clickable buttons. 

Our application also features a "Go back" button that refreshes the page, as well as a "clear search history" button which removes the previous search values from locall storage.
